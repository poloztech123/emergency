Explanation:

    HTML:
        Creates a container element (div) with the ID "map" where the map will be displayed.
        Includes the Google Maps API script with your API key.
    JavaScript:
        Defines functions for initMap, showPosition, and handleError.
        initMap checks if the browser supports geolocation and attempts to get the user's location using navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition.
        showPosition (called upon successful location retrieval):
            Extracts the user's latitude and longitude from the position object.
            Creates a Google Map object centered on the user's coordinates with appropriate zoom level.
            Places a marker at the user's location on the map.
        handleError (called if there's an error obtaining the location):
            Logs the error message to the console.
            You can implement additional error handling logic here, such as displaying an error message to the user.

Important Notes:

    Replace "YOUR_API_KEY" with your actual Google Maps API key.
    This code retrieves the user's location only once. It doesn't provide real-time tracking due to security and privacy limitations.
    Remember to handle potential errors gracefully and inform the user if location access is denied or unavailable.
